        About Us
            <p>
                Founded in 2020, and serving Utah County, Glisten Window Cleaning is at the forefront of window cleaning technology. Our technicians use a deionized water cleaning system that is guaranteed not to leave streaks or spots, and will stay clean and clear longer than windows cleaned with squeegees and soap. 
            </p>
